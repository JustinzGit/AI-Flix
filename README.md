# AI-Flix
AI-Flix is a repository of movies and actors who have starred in those movies. Users can browse this repository to obtain detailed information, leave movie reviews, and create movie playlists. 

AI-Flix can also find the shortest path of movies that connect two provided actors within the database. To accomplish this, AI-Flix uses the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm to traverse a tree of actors and movies until a path is found. Users can leverage these paths to create playlists based upon the alogirthm's output.

Inspiration was drawn from "Bacon's Law" or the Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon, a game based on the concept that any two actors can be linked to Kevin Bacon through their film roles within six degrees of separation. [Bacon's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six_Degrees_of_Kevin_Bacon#:~:text=Six%20Degrees%20of%20Kevin%20Bacon%20or%20%22Bacon's%20Law%22%20is%20a,and%20prolific%20actor%20Kevin%20Bacon.)

Kevin has even started his own charity called [Six Degrees](https://www.sixdegrees.org/about) that has used the popularity of the Bacon's law phenomena to raise money for empowering charities.
